    <li>Born: Marshall Bruce Mathers III, on October 17th, 1972 (47 years young), in St. Joseph, Missouri</li>
    <li>Height: 5′ 7″, but height is just a number</li>
    <li>Band: N/A because the Rap God is a one man show</li>
    <p>
      Born into adversity, Marshall Bruce Mathers III took no shit from birth to now. Hailing from a small redneck town, he rose to prominence in the underground rap battle scene, where he grew tall and mean, but never losing sight of the green. Slow
      and steady he paved the road, so that every future artist can take life by the throat.
